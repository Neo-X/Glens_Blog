<br /><br />Polygon based meshes are very common in computer simulation. You see them all the time in computer simulations and computer games. A common issue in computer simulation is performance. I particular not computing more than we have to during any computer simulation. Although meshes are very complex and useful data structures wouldn't it be nice if when a very detailed mesh is off in the background of some simulation. Methods for assisting with this issue such as this have been around for a couple of years and they are sometimes referred to as Level Of Detail (LOD) algorithms.<br /><br />Mesh simplification is a LOD method. The goal of the simplification is to remove elements, usually edges or vertices, from a mesh while introducing the least amount of error (non-smoothness). Error can be calculated in many ways, some of the best ways being global volume calculations, however we want something that is very fast and practice. For this work I used difference between the sum of the angles around a vertex and 360 degrees (2pi).<br /><br /><ol><li>I started with adding a few debugging annotations</li><ol><li>Highlighting vertices that are about to be removed </li></ol><li>The first step is to construct a priority queue of some sort so that the vertex with the least amount of error can be easily found and removed at each step.</li><li>When a vertex is removed the hole in the mesh needs to be re-triangulated. There are a couple of methods to do this. I used the fan algorithm</li><li>Vertices can be removed until some specified amount of tolerance. For example don't remove vertices that will cause error &gt; e.</li></ol><br /><br /><br /><br />After implementing the annotations to show the top 10 vertices to remove.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HJhce01al7U/VD7ce_LAm2I/AAAAAAAAA9c/sxlPTt9x9Ro/s1600/Cow-Head-1-bottom.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HJhce01al7U/VD7ce_LAm2I/AAAAAAAAA9c/sxlPTt9x9Ro/s1600/Cow-Head-1-bottom.png" height="640" width="601" /></a></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9vOO6S63_BE/VD7ce6YExiI/AAAAAAAAA9g/2kxD98bCZHA/s1600/Cow-Head-1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9vOO6S63_BE/VD7ce6YExiI/AAAAAAAAA9g/2kxD98bCZHA/s1600/Cow-Head-1.png" height="548" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Special thanks to<br /><ol><li><br /></li></ol>
