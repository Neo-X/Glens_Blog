Reinforcemen learning is large and accelerating area of research. The recent advances in combining RL method with Deep learning have given way to solutions to challenging problems [Like playing Atari](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236) and [Robotic Manipulation](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2015-preschool-for-robots/). These advances have been wonderful but as many practitioners might have relized getting these methods to work together is less than trivial. There is a [great book](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/the-book.html) on RL by Richard Sutton that covers the general method in RL. There is also another book on [Deep learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) but in my opinon there my never be enoug recources on how to combine these two methods. In these articles I hope to put together a colection of material that will guide the reader along a path understanding and implimenting a method that could [solve Go](https://research.googleblog.com/2016/01/alphago-mastering-ancient-game-of-go.html) or [learn to walk](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~van/papers/2017-TOG-deepLoco/index.html).
